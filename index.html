<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>Here's one thing that I define myself as: someone that if they like x, they will adore it with all of their being. So, it's not really uncommon if you see me rave and talk for hours about my hobbies. My hobbies include, skecthing, playing video games, going out to try different kinds of foods, reading historical fiction and adventure books (I'm up to read other kinds of books, I don't mind), etc. That aside, I have been interested in two new things: medicine, more specfifically how to find x injury and how to cure said injury, (I will explain more in my projects page) and flamenco. Although I just started doing flamenco, the dance has been apart of my early childhood, since my mother used to regularly attend classes and rehersals.     </p> 


<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Honestly, I do not have a sepcific long term goal that I have in mind,but, what I can tell you is that I want to be able to try out more things and be more risk-taking during shool-year breaks.The reason of why I want to do that is because I always get this urge to participate in something new.</p>
