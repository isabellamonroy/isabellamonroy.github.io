<p> Lately, I have been trying to use more colors into my drawing, since I feel like he repition of just using a pencil was getting boring. In this "painting" I used pastels to draw more attention to the flowers.</p>

<p>This is a rough draft that contains one of my "Original Characters" Lelia. The other drawings in the rough draft (the drawing below and on the right) were created by my friends. The writing that is nearest to my drawing is the critique I wrote down for my own sketch. </p>

<p>Over the summer and in the past month, I started to write down basic medical notes that I will continue to add on. For example, I wrote down notes on how to heal x injury, as well as listing some symptoms. From these notes, I can apply it to the real world by helping people who are injured. I am also considering to buy some medical books for more detailed and reliable information. (I am aware that those books are expensive, but why must they cost so much?) </p>
